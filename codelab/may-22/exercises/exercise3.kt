// Declare a mutable variable to store the current color of a traffic light (as a String, e.g., "Red", "Yellow", "Green").
// Write a when statement (Kotlin's version of a switch statement) that prints the action a driver should take based on the light's color:
// "Red": "Stop"
// "Yellow": "Caution"
// "Green": "Go"
// Any other color: "Invalid light color"
// Change the light color and see the different actions.
